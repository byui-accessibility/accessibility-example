	<h2 id="keyboard-navigation">Keyboard Navigation</h2>
	<a href="#skip-top">Scroll To Top</a>
	<h3 id="skip-link">A "skip link" is provided for all repeating elements on the page</h3>
		<p>Skip links are usually at the very top of the page, and are needed anywhere there is repeating content that is not the main content. Skip links aren’t needed on pages that have minimal interactive content. These could be login pages, home pages, or any pages that don’t have menus. The skip link does not need to be visible unless it is being focused. Some webpages may have multiple skip links that skip to different regions of the page (i.e. “Skip to search”, “Skip to main content”.) Make sure that these links skip to the correct region of the page, and that a good indication around the content that is being focused on is present. Helpful WCAG Posts: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/bypass-blocks">Understanding WCAG Criteria 2.4.1</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G1">Technique G1</a>. This page has two skip content buttons present. One skips the repeating nav bar element, the other skips the table of contents. The skip the table of contents button isn't required but it makes navigating the page easier.</p>
		<p>Some more examples: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jAJa3lJGn1zKIWjMHeZo-3p5FVPVU56x/view">Skip to Main Bad Example</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aYAU2C_s13bqpujvUHKTtToehKl5qbvH/view">Skip to Main Good Example</a>.</p>
	<h3 id="active-elements">All active/onscreen elements are accessible and function properly w/ keyboard</h3>
		<p>All buttons, links, and interactive content that is enabled needs to be accessible with the keyboard. Any content that is disabled (grayed out) does not need to be accessible with the keyboard until active. This does not have to be with the tab key exclusively. Sometimes the arrow keys will navigate a sublist of items, or there will be keyboard shortcuts built into the site. Look around for a list of these shortcuts. If built in shortcuts are present, then the shortcuts have to either be disabled or changed as some accessibility tools can lose their functionality with certain commands. If the shortcuts list takes a while to find (i.e. have a hard time navigating to it via keyboard and/or mouse,) then most likely it can be classified as inaccessible. Helpful WCAG Post: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard.html">Understanding WCAG Criteria 2.1.1</a>. These buttons all being able to be accessed via keyboard navigation is a good example:</p>
		<button class="alert1">Alert 1</button>
		<button class="alert2">Alert 2</button>
		<button class="alert3">Alert 3</button>
	<h3 id="inactive-elements">All inactive/offscreen elements are ignored by keyboard</h3>
		<p>Any content that is hidden, like drop down lists, side menus, or any content that is not displayed to the user until the user interacts with the webpage, needs to be ignored when navigating through the website. Many times, when a user loses track of the focus indicator, this is because the focus indicator is on some hidden content. Losing track of the focus indicator does not automatically mean that the focus is on an element that is offscreen or inactive content. Sometimes the focus will be on a region of the page that is displayed, but isn’t programmed to have a focus indicator around it. You can add your own focus indicator. See this <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:035d1e2865084abbbf00f78087255f72@thread.tacv2/1716929513348?tenantId=e6ac1d1f-d695-4ef1-91d4-94cddef8be11&groupId=ad62b64f-2bf5-47a1-9716-4284718edfda&parentMessageId=1683835864002&teamName=Accessibility%20Specialists&channelName=Software%20Testing&createdTime=1716929513348Q">Teams question</a>. Another way to see if the focus is on an element is to look in the bottom left corner of the browser. Sometimes, there will be a link to another page. If the link does not match anything on the page, or you can’t see it, it may mean the focus is on a hidden menu. Helpful WCAG Post: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-content.html">Understanding WCAG Criteria 1.1.1</a>. Example of a disabled element being ignored until the required fields are filled in:</p>
		<form id="myForm">
			<label for="name">First Name:*</label>
			<input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>

			<label for="last-name">Last Name:*</label>
			<input type="text" id="last-name" name="last-name" required>

			<label for="message">Message:*</label>
			<input type="text" id="message" name="message" required></input>

			<input type="submit" id="submitBtn" value="Submit" disabled>
		</form>
		<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16uwmO4Lc-twLErUVctpIgwb8NLfP_BZH/view">Example of failure</a>.</p>
	<h3 id="focus-indicator">Focus indicator is easily visible and consistent throughout page</h3>
		<p>There needs to be an easy to see focus indicator throughout the page. This focus indicator should be a box around the element receiving focus, a change in the background color, and/or a cursor blinking in a text input field. Optimally, the color will be a stark contrast to the element before receiving focus. Many websites will use a solid black or red line around the element. Sometimes part of the focus indicator will be hidden behind some of the surrounding elements. The focus indicator needs to be visible entirely to ensure that the user knows where they are on the page. Helpful WCAG Post: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-visible">Understanding WCAG Criteria 2.4.7</a>. The focus indicator on this page is easily seen on these buttons:</p>
		<button class="alert1">Alert 1</button>
		<button class="alert2">Alert 2</button>
		<button class="alert3">Alert 3</button>
	<h3 id="navigation-order">Navigation order is logical follows the flow of the page</h3>
		<p>Generally, navigation of a page is expected to be top to bottom, left to right. Sometimes a page will be vertically sectioned off and the navigation flow will not exactly follow this order. Instead, the order should follow the sections structure as they go top to bottom, left to right. Helpful WCAG Posts: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-order">Understanding WCAG Criteria 2.4.3</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/meaningful-sequence">Understanding WCAG Criteria 1.3.2</a>. Navigation flows left to right for these buttons (this is logical.)</p>
		<button class="alert1">Alert 1</button>
		<button class="alert2">Alert 2</button>
		<button class="alert3">Alert 3</button>
		<p>Here is a helpful diagram of what keyboard navigation of a section page should be like:</p>
		<img id="flow-img" src="./Sources/page-flow.png" alt="a sectioned website with navigation from top to bottom, left to right, but going inside a section before going right.">
	<h3 id="menus-navigation">Menus are easy to navigate, logical, and intuitive</h3>
		<p>Menus should be logical, intuitive, and easy to navigate. A dropdown menu should only be interacted with if the user has intentionally opened it, such as by pressing enter. When navigating a website's menu, users should jump through parent elements, ignoring child elements until a parent is selected. Pressing escape should collapse the menu, allowing users to continue navigation seamlessly. Helpful WCAG Post: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/">Menus Tutorial</a>. Here is an example navigation menu that uses a dropdown menu. In the following example, the dropdown menu doesn't open while focusing over it, the user has to open the menu by pressing enter.</p>
		<div id="nav">
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#skip-top">Top of Page</a></li>
				<li><a href="#intro">Heading 1</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a></li>

					<div class="dropdown-menu">

			</ul>
		</div>
	<h3 id="forms-navigation">Forms are easy to navigate, logical, and intuitive</h3>
		<p>Forms should follow usual navigation techniques. Forms will have many different input types and styles. The type of information required by certain fields in the form needs to be specified by the form. The formatting of the data also needs to be specified (i.e. A date input field needing to be MM/DD/YY should be specified.) All input fields should have a correct and properly assigned label. A label can be added via the label element and using the for attribute, using aria-label, aria-labelledby, or using title (not recommended.) A label can be hidden as long as the input still makes sense in the context (i.e. having a text input field next to a search button.) Any required input fields should be labeled as required (usually just the * symbol or the text "required" in the label will suffice.) If the user puts in incorrect information, there needs to be an accessible error message stating that correct information.

Forms that span multiple pages also need indication of where the user is in the form process. This will oftentimes show up in the form of breadcrumbs at the top of the page.

This is a good example of a form because all inputs have a properly assigned label and are assigned the correct type of input (all text in this example.) It should be noted that there should be a submission confirmation that says the form was successfully submitted.
		<form id="myForm">
			<label for="nav-name">First Name:*</label>
			<input type="text" id="nav-name"required>

			<label for="nav-last-name">Last Name:*</label>

	<h3 id="multiple-ways">Multiple ways are available to the user to find other webpages on the site</h3>
		<p>To put it simply, this criteria means that every webpage can easily be found unless the page is a step in a process (i.e. a multi page form doesn't need every page to be easily found.) For small websites, a simple navigation bar/menu will suffice. If it's a large website then a search mechanism would be best. Helpful WCAG Post: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/multiple-ways">Understanding WCAG Criteria 2.4.5</a>. WCAG 2.1 and 2.2 Guidelines says using two or more of the following techniques is sufficient:</p>

	<h3 id="no-unexpected-changes">Interacting with elements on the page doesn't cause any unexpected, dramatic changes that may confuse the user</h3>
		<p>Elements that affect a page should be easily understood and should not change the page in a way that can cause the user to become confused (i.e. random pop ups, pages to other websites being navigated to unexpectedly, etc.) Helpful WCAG Post: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/on-input">Understanding WCAG Criteria 3.2.2</a>. In the following example, interacting with the elements is predictable. Their interactions and changes are expected because of the button's stating their purpose. It is also not dramatic as there is immediate and understandable feedback on what changes.</p>
		<div class="container">
			<div class="box" class="colorBox" id="colorBox" tabindex="0" aria-label="lightblue box"></div>
			<div class="expected-message"></div>
			<button onclick="changeColor('lightcoral')">Change to Coral</button>
			<button onclick="changeColor('lightgreen')">Change to Green</button>
			<button onclick="displayMessage()">Display Message</button>
		</div>
	<h3 id="auto-updating-content">Automatically updating content can be paused, stopped, hidden or allow user to modify the timing of content</h3>
		<p>All elements that have a timer and/or update automatically should have a function to affect the change of the element. These elements/content should have one of the following be true: be able to be turned off, allow its time to be adjusted before it starts, extended before the time expires, have a time limit greater than 20 hours, the element is in real time (i.e. an auction,) or changing the time would invalidate the activity. Helpful WCAG Post: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/pause-stop-hide">Understanding WCAG Criteria 2.2.2</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/timing-adjustable">Understanding WCAG Criteria 2.2.1</a>.

			<input type="number" id="interval" value="2000" min="500" step="500">
			<button onclick="updateInterval()">Set Interval</button>
		</div>
	<h3 id="consistent-keys">Keys used in navigation are consistent and logical throughout webpage/website</h3>
		<p>Keyboard navigation buttons should be consistent across the same elements on the page and across the website. For example, tabbing through active elements that have a function would meet this criteria. On this website, every page uses the same ways to navigate. You can use tab to access all elements and arrow keys to change certain elements (like the interval in the previous section.) Helpful WCAG Post: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-navigation">Understanding WCAG Criteria 3.2.3</a>.</p>
	<h3 id="key-commands-off">Key commands built into site can be turned off or are only active on certain elements of the page</h3>
		<p>If commands are a part of the whole site, the user should be able to easily change the commands. If there are custom commands in a command area (like in the next example) it would be best to provide a way to change the commands, but not required. All commands that are just a letter anywhere on a website should allow the user to change the command and add another identifier (like CTRL + the character.) Helpful WCAG Post: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/character-key-shortcuts">Understanding WCAG Criteria 2.1.4</a>. The following example shows a command area with custom commands. An issue with the command areas in this example is that setting it to CTRL + T opens up a new tab instead of creating the alert.</p>
		<div class="command-area" id="commandArea1" tabindex="0">
			<p>This is a command area. Press <span id="command1">Ctrl + C</span> to copy.</p>
			<label for="commandInput1">Enter a new command:</label>
			<input type="text" id="commandInput1">
			<button onclick="updateCommand(1)">Update Command</button>

		<div class="command-area" id="commandArea2" tabindex="0">
			<p>This is another command area. Press <span id="command2">Ctrl + S</span> to save.</p>
			<label for="commandInput2">Enter a new command:</label>
			<input type="text" id="commandInput2">
			<button onclick="updateCommand(2)">Update Command</button>
		</div>
	<h3 id="close-dynamic-content">The user has a way to close content that is dynamically added to the webpage without deleting other content</h3>
		<p>Whenever dynamically added content is added to the page, like a pop-up window, the user can close the content and not close any other content when they do. Sometimes the content won't be focused or be focusable after navigating the whole page, which both are not compliant. When something pops up and covers other elements, it should become the focus. Helpful WCAG Post: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/client-side-script/SCR26">Understanding Technique SCR26</a>. The following shows an example of the user dynamically adding content in the form of text. Since the user is adding the content, it should appear after the add content button so that the user can more easily navigate it by going further along in the page.</p>
		<button onclick="addContent()">Add Content</button>
		<div id="content-container">
			<div class="content-item">
				<p>This is existing content.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	<h3 id="focusing-prevents-disappearing">Focusing prevents additional content from disappearing</h3>
		<p>Elements that are only shown while its parent element is focused can be present on pages (like a dropdown menu.) Sometimes, the child elements will disappear while using keyboard navigation when focusing on them because the parent element isn't focused. That does not meet the criteria. When navigating the children elements, they should not disappear until they are no longer focused. Content also should not disappear/change while the user is focusing on it unless it is no longer valid/relevant. Helpful WCAG Post: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/content-on-hover-or-focus">Understanding WCAG Criteria 1.4.13</a>. In this example, whenever the focus changes from the show additional content button to the alert button, the alert button does not disappear. It should be noted that since the focus on me button acts like a dropdown menu, it should allow the user to skip the alert button in it.</p>
		<div id="additional-focus">
		<button class="focusable-button">
			<span>Focus on me to show additional content ▼</span>
		</button>
		<button class="additional-content" onclick="focusAlert()">
			<span>Click me to create an alert!</span>
		</button>
		</div>
	<h3 id="additional-content-visible">Additional content is visible for as long as the user needs it, or until the information is no longer valid or relevant</h3>
		<p>See the <a href="#auto-updating-content">Automatically updating content can be paused, stopped, hidden or allow user to modify the timing of content</a> criteria for an example where content is visible for as long as the user needs it.</p>
		<p>Additional content is anything in the website that wasn't there when the page loaded. It is generally added whenever the user completes some action or interacts with an element (i.e. clicks a button.) The added content should be accessed for as long as the user needs or until the information is no longer correct or relevant.

	<h3 id="no-keyboard-traps">No keyboard traps exist on the page</h3>
		<p>A keyboard trap happens when a user is navigating via their keyboard and they get stuck in an area/component. The only way for the user to leave the trap is to either use a mouse to click out of it, reloading the page, or some other non-standard command that changes focus. If the page gives a command to exit the component then that meets guidelines. If you ever have to use anything besides basic keyboard navigation, or an easily displayed/explained way to continue navigating then it is most likely a compliance issue. This page has no keyboard traps so it is a good example. Helpful WCAG Post: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/no-keyboard-trap.html">Understanding WCAG Criteria 2.1.2</a>.</p>

Headings with an equal or higher rank start a new section while headings with a lower rank start a new subsection. Heading levels going down should not be skipped (i.e. A heading level 2 should not be followed by a heading level 4.) It is ok to skip headings when going up (i.e. A heading level 4 is followed by a heading level 2 that starts a new section.) In most cases, a heading level 1 should be present.

This also includes smooth scrolling which is present in this page. At the top of the page, a warning is given so those that are affected can turn off the animation because this page respects the reduce-motion CSS query. This isn't required but it is good to add since it can help the user experience for those that have an affected disability. Another way this could be met is having a built in control to turn on/off the animation. Ensure that the content can be paused/stopped via keyboard navigation.
